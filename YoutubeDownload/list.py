from pytube import Playlist, YouTube
# we can see playlist with Playlist. Video variable have every video url once.
# but I can't download with video.streams..., so I use Youtube() 
#pl = input("Url:")
pl = input("Playlist URL:  ")
location = input("Location:")
playlist = Playlist(pl)
# video = "https:", video variable have url
for video in playlist:
    yt = YouTube(video, location = "D:\Siber GÃ¼venlik\Egitim\WebHack")
    print("Downloading  :",yt.title)
    yt.streams.get_highest_resolution().download(output_path=location)
    print("Downloaded  :", yt.title)
